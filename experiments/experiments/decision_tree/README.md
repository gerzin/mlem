This folder contains the experiments with a `Decision Tree` used in place of the `LIME`s `Ridge Regressor`.

Folders structure:

* `noisy_dataset` contains the experiments where the noisy "validation" dataset is used for the creation of the shadow models.

* `decision_tree_dataset` contains the experiments where the same dataset used to build the `Decision Tree` is used for the creation of the shadow models.
