# MIA with Local Explanation Methods

Clone the following repo with:
```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/gerzin/mlem.git
```

Create a virtual environment by using:
```
$ python -m venv virtualenv
```

Source it with:
```
$ source ./virtualenv/bin/activate
```

You can install two versions of the dependencies. The first one installs the traditional PyTorch:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The second one uses PyTorch with CUDA support:

```
$ pip install -r requirements_gpu.txt
```
